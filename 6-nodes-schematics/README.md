6 nodes varient Raspberry Pi 2 cluster schematics in Illustrator CS 5.0 format and EPS format.  

Each format contains four different boards. Please cut one piece of each board and two pieces of [board-middle](https://github.com/stkim1/pocketcluster/blob/master/6-nodes-schematics/eps/board-middle.eps). Then follow an assembly instruction posted on [PocketCluster](https://pocketcluster.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/free-schematic-raspberry-pi-2-cluster-assembly-tutorial/).
